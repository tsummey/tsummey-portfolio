        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I am a seasoned cybersecurity executive with 25+ years of experience, driving innovative security strategies that align with business growth and operational resilience. As <strong>Senior Manager at Verizon</strong>, I led a 30% improvement in threat detection while saving $12K monthly by optimizing AWS infrastructure. My expertise spans AI-driven security, cloud architecture, regulatory compliance (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR), and advanced security frameworks like Zero Trust. I have a proven record of enhancing security postures for Fortune 500 companies, the Department of Defense, and government entities such as DHS and CISA.
