    <section id="about">
        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            As a cybersecurity executive with over 25 years of experience, I excel in architecting and implementing robust security strategies that align with business objectives, drive operational efficiency, and enhance resilience. At Verizon, I led a 30% improvement in threat detection and achieved $12K monthly savings by optimizing cloud infrastructure and leveraging AI-driven automation to strengthen MDR/XDR services. My expertise spans across AI-enhanced security, cloud architecture (AWS, Azure), regulatory compliance (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR), and advanced security frameworks like Zero Trust.

            I have a proven track record of working with Fortune 500 companies and federal entities, including partnerships with DHS and CISA to enhance national cybersecurity. My leadership in cross-functional teams has delivered enterprise-wide solutions in incident response, business continuity, and disaster recovery—ensuring compliance while mitigating risk. Skilled in both strategic foresight and technical execution, I am committed to driving security innovation and enabling organizations to navigate today’s complex threat landscape.
