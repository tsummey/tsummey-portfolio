        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I am a cybersecurity executive with 25+ years of experience, specializing in aligning innovative security strategies with business growth. 
            As <strong>Senior Manager at Verizon</strong>, I led global enhancements to MDR/XDR services, boosting threat detection by 30% while optimizing cloud infrastructure to save $12K monthly.
        </p>
        <p>
            With expertise spanning <strong>AI-driven security</strong>, <strong>cloud architecture</strong>, and regulatory compliance (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR), I have delivered transformative results for Fortune 500 companies and federal clients alike. 
            My leadership in deploying advanced security solutions—such as <strong>Zero Trust Architecture</strong> and <strong>SOAR</strong>—has been pivotal in securing complex environments and driving down costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Certified in <strong>Data Science from MIT</strong>, I bring a data-driven approach to cybersecurity, combining AI with hands-on expertise in tools like <strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Sentinel</strong>, and SIEM platforms to automate and streamline threat detection and incident response.
